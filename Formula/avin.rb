  # Run-time dependencies. avin links every program with clang, which Xcode's command-line tools
  # provide. The runtime's archive ships prebuilt, so a program that reaches no Sysl binding needs
  # nothing more; a program that does -- the standard library's string case mapping, files,
  # processes and threads are bindings -- has its shims built by the Sysl compiler, which brings
  # LLVM's archiver with it.
