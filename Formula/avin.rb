  # Run-time dependencies. avin links every program with clang, which Xcode's command-line tools
  # provide. The runtime's archive ships prebuilt, so a program that reaches no Sysl binding needs
  # nothing more; a program that does -- the standard library's string case mapping, files,
  # processes and threads are bindings -- has its shims built by the Sysl compiler, which brings
  # LLVM's archiver with it.
  depends_on "sysl-lang/tap/sysl"

  # TLS -- `avin.net.tls` and `https` in `avin.net.http` -- binds the Sysl package `openssl`, which
  # links the machine's OpenSSL, found by pkg-config, and trusts its certificate store.
  depends_on "openssl@3"

  # A collection out of Sysl is converted by two generic shim overloads, for a slice and a `Buf`,
  # that a program can reach at the same type argument, which needs Sysl 0.9.0; a handle passed to a
  # `&T` parameter is shared rather than copied, and a socket closes when its last copy goes, from
  # Sysl 0.9.1; the runtime's lightweight threads stand on `sysl.fiber` and `sysl.io.poll`, from Sysl
  # 0.9.6, with a stack's real bounds from 0.9.7; and a command's `detach`, the memory a process holds
  # and descriptors closed across a program's start come from Sysl 0.9.8; `exec` and
  # waiting for a child by its pid, and a missing process told as not found, from Sysl 0.9.9; and the
  # members of a process group and the children of a process from Sysl 0.9.10. The runtime's
  # package is built with Sysl 0.9.20 and names that release. A dependency cannot name a least
  # version, so it is checked here.
